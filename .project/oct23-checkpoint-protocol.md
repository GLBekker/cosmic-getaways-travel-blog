- **frontend_developer progress reports**: Collect via daily syncs
- **Blocker detection**: Real-time escalation if >2h delays
- **Integration health**: Spot-check for technical issues
- **Responsive design baseline**: Verify early breakpoints (1920px / 1024px)

## Integration Lead Verification Steps

### 1. Collect frontend_developer Report (Oct 23, 23:00-23:30)
- Request formal checkpoint status
- Verify 50% assembly completion
- Document any blockers

### 2. Technical Validation (Oct 23, 23:30-23:45)
- [ ] Review delivered components (if code available)
- [ ] Verify Git commits to feature branch
- [ ] Check PR status (if submitted)
- [ ] Spot-check responsive baseline

### 3. Assessment (Oct 23, 23:45-23:59)
- Calculate actual % complete vs 50% target
- Identify any risks for Oct 24 delivery
- Assess whether 100% completion by Oct 24 EOD is achievable
- Escalate if <40% or >4h behind

### 4. Report to Echo (Oct 24, 00:00-00:15)
- Submit checkpoint status
- Confirm trajectory to Oct 24 completion
- Report any escalations needed
- Recommend adjustments if needed

---

## Escalation Triggers

### RED FLAGS (Escalate Immediately)
- [ ] <40% complete (behind schedule)
- [ ] Critical blocking issue detected
- [ ] Cannot meet Oct 24 EOD deadline
- [ ] Performance unacceptable (LCP >5s)
- [ ] Accessibility failures (WCAG 2.1 AA violations)

### YELLOW FLAGS (Monitor Closely)
- [ ] 40-50% complete (on track but tight)
- [ ] Minor blockers present but mitigated
- [ ] Performance concerns (LCP 3-5s) - optimizable
- [ ] Minor accessibility issues - fixable by Oct 24

### GREEN SIGNAL (All Clear)
- [ ] 50%+ complete (ahead of schedule)
- [ ] No blockers detected
- [ ] Performance acceptable (LCP <3s)
- [ ] Code quality good (clean console)
- [ ] Trajectory solid for Oct 24 delivery

---

## Contingency Actions (If Behind)

### If <40% Complete (CRITICAL)
1. Escalate to Echo immediately
2. Identify root cause (technical blocker / scope creep / resource issue)
3. Propose mitigation:
   - Reduce scope (defer non-critical features)
   - Add resources (content_creator / image_generator support)
   - Adjust deadline (unlikely - Oct 25 launch locked)
4. Confirm revised delivery plan

### If 40-50% Complete (ON TRACK)
1. Monitor closely through Oct 24
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Confirm 100% delivery feasible
4. Proceed with Plan A

### If >50% Complete (AHEAD)
1. Maintain momentum
2. Begin QA testing early
3. Address any discovered issues proactively
4. Target Oct 24 early delivery
