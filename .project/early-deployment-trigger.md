## Activation Protocol

### Condition Check (Oct 24, 22:00-23:30)
1. Verify all 6 trigger conditions met
2. Document verification results
3. Confirm production readiness: YES/NO

### If ALL Conditions MET:
- **Status**: EARLY DEPLOYMENT CLEARED
- **Action**: Deploy to production immediately
- **Timeline**: Oct 24 EOD or earlier (upon completion)
- **Report**: Confirm deployment to Echo

### If ANY Condition NOT MET:
- **Status**: DEFER TO Oct 25
- **Action**: Continue QA fixes through Oct 24
- **Timeline**: Oct 25 standard deployment window
- **Report**: Document gaps + mitigation plan

---

## Real-Time Monitoring (Oct 23-24)

### Continuous Tracking
- [ ] Carousel sprint progress: Daily update
- [ ] QA spot-checks: Real-time as components complete
- [ ] Performance baseline: Continuous measurement
- [ ] Blocker detection: Armed for escalation
- [ ] Escalation readiness: Echo support standing by

### Daily Checkpoints
- **Oct 23 EOD (23:30)**: Carousel progress + blockers
- **Oct 24 midday**: 75% carousel estimate + QA findings
- **Oct 24 EOD (22:00)**: Trigger condition verification begins
- **Oct 24 EOD (23:30)**: Final early deployment decision

## Success Criteria for EARLY DEPLOYMENT

**DEPLOY IMMEDIATELY if:**
- [ ] Carousel 100% complete & locked
- [ ] All 6 trigger conditions verified PASSED
- [ ] No critical blockers detected
- [ ] Production build ready & tested
- [ ] Echo confirms deployment readiness

**RESULT**: Production deployment Oct 24 EOD (before Oct 25 standard window)

**DEFER TO Oct 25 if:**
- [ ] Any trigger condition NOT met
- [ ] Critical issues found in final QA
- [ ] Cannot guarantee production readiness
- [ ] Echo recommends deferral for safety

---

## Communication Plan

**If EARLY DEPLOYMENT CLEARED:**
1. Notify Echo immediately upon verification
2. Proceed with production deployment
3. Monitor deployment health post-launch
4. Team celebration & project wrap

**If DEFERRING TO Oct 25:**
1. Document gaps + mitigation
2. Continue QA through Oct 24
3. Deploy on Oct 25 standard timeline
4. Team focus on final polish

## Momentum Sustainability

- Frontend Developer: Maximum velocity through completion
- Integration Lead: Continuous monitoring + real-time QA
- Echo: Standing by for early deployment decision
- Contingency: Not needed (team executing flawlessly)

**Final Target**: Ship Cosmic Getaways (early or Oct 25 standard - both locked & ready)
