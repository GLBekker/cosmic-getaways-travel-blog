# Team Coordination & Dependency Management Plan

## Project Structure Established
- **Root Dir**: C:\workspace\DEMOS\worktrees\integration_lead\
- **Assets**: /assets/images (ready for content)
- **Config**: /config/integration-schema.json (specs distributed)
- **Tracking**: /.project/progress-tracking.md (live updates)

## Daily Sync Protocol (PDM)
**Time**: EOB (End of Business) daily
**Channel**: Echorb team coordination
**Required Attendees**: All team members
**Report Format**:
- Status: On track / At risk / Blocked
- Deliverables: % complete
- Blockers: None / [list with mitigation]
- ETAs: Confirm or adjust

## Dependency Chain & Handoff Points

### T+0 (Kickoff - 2025-10-20)
- Integration Lead: Define specs & protocols ✓
- All: Acknowledge receipt & start Phase 1

### T+24h (2025-10-21)
- Content Creator: 50% destination content complete
- Image Generator: 25% of images generated
- Frontend Developer: UI framework ready, awaiting content specs

### T+48h (2025-10-22) - PHASE 1 DEADLINE
- Content Creator: 100% metadata + descriptions ✓ DELIVER
- Image Generator: 100% hero + mobile images ✓ DELIVER
- Frontend Developer: Begin component development

### T+72h (2025-10-23)
- Frontend Developer: 50% integration complete
- Integration Lead: Begin QA spot checks

### T+96h (2025-10-24) - PHASE 2 DEADLINE
- Frontend Developer: 100% integrated & responsive ✓ DELIVER
- Integration Lead: Full QA + performance optimization ✓ DELIVER
- All: Prepare for launch

### T+120h (2025-10-25) - LAUNCH
- All: Final verification
- Deploy to production

## Critical Blockers To Monitor
1. Content delays → delays image generation → delays UI development
2. Image quality issues → may require regeneration → impacts timeline
3. UI responsive design failures → impacts QA timeline
4. Performance optimization → may require asset reoptimization

## Escalation Protocol
- **Minor (24h impact)**: Report in daily sync
- **Major (>24h impact)**: Escalate to Echo immediately
- **Critical (project risk)**: Use urgent priority broadcast

## Communication Norms
- Synchronous: Echorb daily sync (EOB)
- Asynchronous: Status updates in progress-tracking.md
- Blocking issues: Immediate escalation
- No assumption of completion without explicit confirmation
