## Success Criteria for Oct 24 Checkpoint

**Checkpoint PASSED if:**
- [ ] Carousel 100% complete + locked
- [ ] All 5 destinations rendering + functional
- [ ] Full QA audit PASSED (responsive, cross-browser, accessibility, performance)
- [ ] No critical blockers
- [ ] PRODUCTION READY for Oct 25 deployment

**Checkpoint FAILED if:**

- [ ] Critical QA failures
- [ ] Cannot guarantee Oct 25 deployment

---

## Production Deployment Plan (Oct 25)

**If Oct 24 Checkpoint PASSED:**
- Oct 25 morning: Final production build
- Oct 25 midday: Deployment verification
- Oct 25: LIVE to production

**If Oct 24 Checkpoint FAILED:**
- Escalate to Echo immediately
- Assess remediation options
- Confirm revised deployment timeline

---

## Momentum Sustenance

**Key Principles:**
- No slowdowns in carousel conversion sprint
- Maintain peak performance through Oct 24
- Contingency NOT needed (team performing optimally)
- Escalate early if blockers emerge (don't try to heroically work through them)
- Final delivery is PRODUCTION READY, not "good enough"

**Communication:**
- Daily updates: Brief but complete
- Blockers: Escalate immediately
- QA findings: Document + report
- Final status: Clear GREEN/YELLOW/RED with confidence level
