- happy: For positive outcomes, successful completions
- excited: For breakthrough discoveries, major achievements  
- sad: For errors, failures, or disappointing results
- angry: For frustrating bugs or blocking issues
- tired: After long computations or repetitive tasks

- focused: During deep analysis or complex problem-solving

Each emotion creates unique visual expressions that persist for 10+ seconds.
